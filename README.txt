README - Language::Prolog Interpreter
-------------------------------------

An apparently untended module, Language::Prolog has
all sorts of potential.  I don't know how far I'll
add to it, but this distribution is a replacement
for the main distribution's *Interpreter* module,
and allows the reading of files, which may contain
multi-line clauses, single- or multi-line clauses.

Maybe I'll add more later.

Maybe the original author and owner will turn up.

Who knows?
